                Stochastic pro-positionalization of non-determinate background knowledge. : It is a well-known fact that propositional learning algorithms require "good" features to perform well in practice. So a major step in data engineering for inductive learning is the construction of good features by domain experts. These features often represent properties of structured objects, where a property typically is the occurrence of a certain substructure having certain properties. To partly automate the process of "feature engineering", we devised an algorithm that searches for features which are defined by such substructures. The algorithm stochastically conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, where each clause represents a binary feature. It differs from existing algorithms in that its search is not class-blind, and that it is capable of considering clauses ("context") of almost arbitrary length (size). Preliminary experiments are favorable, and support the view that this approach is promising.            Task:

                Looking at Markov samplers through CUM-SUM path plots: a simple diagnostic idea. : In this paper, we propose to monitor a Markov chain sampler using the cusum path plot of a chosen 1-dimensional summary statistic. We argue that the cusum path plot can bring out, more effectively than the sequential plot, those aspects of a Markov sampler which tell the user how quickly or slowly the sampler is moving around in its sample space, in the direction of the summary statistic. The proposal is then illustrated in four examples which represent situations where the cusum path plot works well and not well. Moreover, a rigorous analysis is given for one of the examples. We conclude that the cusum path plot is an effective tool for convergence diagnostics of a Markov sampler and for comparing different Markov samplers.

                Evolving sensors in environments of controlled complexity. : 1 . Sensors represent a crucial link between the evolutionary forces shaping a species' relationship with its environment, and the individual's cognitive abilities to behave and learn. We report on experiments using a new class of "latent energy environments" (LEE) models to define environments of carefully controlled complexity which allow us to state bounds for random and optimal behaviors that are independent of strategies for achieving the behaviors. Using LEE's analytic basis for defining environments, we then use neural networks (NNets) to model individuals and a steady - state genetic algorithm to model an evolutionary process shaping the NNets, in particular their sensors. Our experiments consider two types of "contact" and "ambient" sensors, and variants where the NNets are not allowed to learn, learn via error correction from internal prediction, and via reinforcement learning. We find that predictive learning, even when using a larger repertoire of the more sophisticated ambient sensors, provides no advantage over NNets unable to learn. However, reinforcement learning using a small number of crude contact sensors does provide a significant advantage. Our analysis of these results points to a tradeoff between the genetic "robustness" of sensors and their informativeness to a learning system.

                dQUOB: Managing Large Data Flows Using Dynamic Embedded Queries The dQUOB system satisfies client need for specific information from high-volume data streams. The data streams we speak of are the flow of data existing during large-scale visualizations, video streaming to large numbers of distributed users, and high volume business transactions. We introduces the notion of conceptualizing a data stream as a set of relational database tables so that a scientist can request information with an SQL-like query. Transformation or computation that often needs to be performed on the data en-route can be conceptualized ascomputation performed onconsecutive views of the data, with computation associated with each view. The dQUOB system moves the query code into the data stream as a quoblet; as compiled code. The relational database data model has the significant advantage of presenting opportunities for efficient reoptimizations of queries and sets of queries. Using examples from global atmospheric modeling, we illustrate the usefulness of the dQUOB system. We carry the examples through the experiments to establish the viability of the approach for high performance computing with a baseline benchmark. We define a cost-metric of end-to-end latency that can be used to determine realistic cases where optimization should be applied. Finally, we show that end-to-end latency can be controlled through a probability assigned to a query that a query will evaluate to true.            Task:

                Statistical Pattern Recognition: A Review Abstract√êThe primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.

                Group Task Analysis for Groupware Usability Evaluations Techniques for inspecting the usability of groupware applications have recently been proposed. These techniques focus on the mechanics of collaboration rather than the work context in which a system is used, and offer time and cost savings by not requiring actual users or fully-functional prototypes. Although these techniques are valuable, adding information about task and work context could improve the quality of inspection results. We introduce a method for analysing group tasks that can be used to add context to discount groupware evaluation techniques. Our method allows for the specification of collaborative scenarios and tasks by considering the mechanics of collaboration, levels of coupling during task performance, and variability in task execution. We describe how this type of task analysis could be used in a new inspection technique based on cognitive walkthrough.

                Emergent Cooperative Goal-Satisfaction in Large Scale Automated-Agent Systems Cooperation among autonomous agents has been discussed in the DAI community for several years. Papers about cooperation [6, 45], negotiation [33], distributed planning [5], and coalition formation [28, 48], have provided a variety of approaches and several algorithms and solutions to situations wherein cooperation is possible. However, the case of cooperation in large-scale multi-agent systems (MAS) has not been thoroughly examined. Therefore, in this paper we present a framework for cooperative goal-satisfaction in large-scale environments focusing on a low complexity physics-oriented approach. The multi-agent systems with which we deal are modeled by a physics-oriented model. According to the model, MAS inherit physical properties, and therefore the evolution of the computational systems is similar to the evolution of physical systems. To enable implementation of the model, we provide a detailed algorithm to be used by a single agent within the system. The model and the algorithm are a...

                Managing Robot Autonomy and Interactivity Using Motives and Visual Communication An autonomous mobile robot operating in everyday life conditions will have to face a huge variety of situations and to interact with other agents (living or artificial). Such a robot needs flexible and robust methods for managing its goals and for adapting its control mechanisms to face the contingencies of the world. It also needs to communicate with others in order to get useful information about the world. This paper describes an approach based on a general architecture and on internal variables called `motives' to manage the goals of an autonomous robot.

                Title: Glycemic response to newly initiated diabetes therapies.
                Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The glycemic response to antihyperglycemic therapies for type 2 diabetes has been thoroughly evaluated in randomized controlled trials, but inadequately studied in real-world settings. STUDY DESIGN: We studied glycemic response among 15 126 type 2 diabetic patients who initiated any single new antihyperglycemic agent (metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or insulin added to medical nutrition therapy or to existing diabetes therapies) during 1999-2000 within Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system. METHODS: Pre-post (3-12 months after initiation) change in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) was analyzed using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) models adjusted for baseline A1C, concurrent (ongoing) antihyperglycemic therapy, demographics, health behaviors, medication adherence, clinical factors, and processes of care. RESULTS: Mean A1C was 9.01% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.98%-9.04%) before therapy initiation and 7.87% (95% CI 7.85%-7.90%) 3 to 12 months after initiation (mean A1C reduction 1.14 percentage points; 95% CI 1.11-1.17). Overall, 30.2% (95% CI 29.2%-31.1%) of patients achieved glycemic target (A1C < 7%). Although baseline disease severity and concurrent therapies differed greatly across therapeutic classes, after adjustment for these baseline clinical characteristics, no significant differences were noted in glucose-lowering effect across therapeutic classes. Treatment effects did not differ by age, race, diabetes duration, obesity, or level of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin, sulfonylures, thiazolidinediones, and insulin were equally effective in improving glucose control. Nonetheless, most patients failed to achieve the glycemic target. Findings suggest that, to keep up with progressive worsening of glycemic control, patients and providers must commit to earlier, more aggressive therapy intensification, triggered promptly after A1C exceeds the recommended glycemic target.

                Title: Thyroid autoimmunity in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a multicenter survey.
                Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate thyroid autoimmunity in a very large nationwide cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from 17,749 patients with type 1 diabetes aged 0.1-20 years who were treated in 118 pediatric diabetes centers in Germany and Austria. Antibodies to thyroglobulin (anti-TG) and thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) were measured and documented at least once in 7,097 patients. A total of 49.5% of these patients were boys, the mean age was 12.4 years (range 0.3-20.0 years), and the mean duration of diabetes was 4.5 years (range 0.0-19.5 years). A titer exceeding 100 units/ml or 1:100 was considered significantly elevated. RESULTS: In 1,530 patients, thyroid antibody levels were elevated on at least one occasion, whereas 5,567 were antibody-negative during the observation period. Patients with thyroid antibodies were significantly older (P < 0.001), had a longer duration of diabetes (P < 0.001), and developed diabetes later in life (P < 0.001) than those without antibodies. A total of 63% of patients with positive antibodies were girls, compared with 45% of patients without antibodies (P < 0.001). The prevalence of significant thyroid antibody titers increased with increasing age; the highest prevalence was in the 15- to 20-year age group (anti-TPO: 16.9%, P < 0.001; anti-TG: 12.8%, P < 0.001). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were higher in patients with thyroid autoimmunity (3.34 microU/ml, range 0.0-615.0 microU/ml) than in control subjects (1.84 microU/ml, range 0.0-149.0 microU/ml) (P < 0.001). Even higher TSH levels were observed in patients with both anti-TPO and anti-TG (4.55 microU/ml, range 0.0-197.0 microU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid autoimmunity seems to be particularly common in girls with diabetes during the second decade of life and may be associated with elevated TSH levels, indicating subclinical hypothyroidism.

                Title: Specific changes of somatostatin mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of diabetic rats.
                Abstract: Abstract Most current studies of diabetic encephalopathy have focused on brain blood flow and metabolism, but there has been little research on the influence of diabetes on brain tissue and the causes of chronic diabetic encephalopathy. The technique of molecular biology makes it possible to explore the mechanism of chronic diabetic encephalopathy by testing the distribution of somatostatin in the brain. We have therefore analysed, by in situ hybridization histochemistry, the changes in somatostatin (SST) mRNA in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats made diabetic by the injection of streptozotocin. Ten Sprague-Dawley control rats were compared with ten streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The weight, blood glucose and urine glucose did not differ between the two groups before the injection of streptozotocin. Four weeks after the injection of streptozotocin the weight, blood glucose and urine glucose of the diabetic rats were, respectively, 199.1 +/- 15.6 g, 23.7 +/- 3.25 mmol L(-1) and (++) to (+++) whereas those of the control group were 265.5 +/- 30.3 g, 4.84 +/- 0.63 mmol L(-1) and (-). Somatostatin mRNA was reduced in the diabetic rats. The number of SST mRNA-positive neurons and the optical density of positive cells in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the diabetic rats were 80.6 +/- 17.5 mm(-2) and 76.5 +/- 17.6 compared with 150.5 +/- 21.1 mm(-2) and 115.1 +/- 18.5 in the control rats. The induction of diabetes is thus associated with a decreased expression of SST mRNA in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, which might be an important component of chronic diabetic encephalopathy

                the exp log normal form of types decomposing extensional equality and representing terms compactly Lambda calculi with algebraic data types lie at the core of functional programming languages and proof assistants, but conceal at least two fundamental theoretical problems already in the presence of the simplest non-trivial data type, the sum type. First, we do not know of an explicit and implemented algorithm for deciding the beta-eta-equality of terms---and this in spite of the first decidability results proven two decades ago. Second, it is not clear how to decide when two types are essentially the same, i.e. isomorphic, in spite of the meta-theoretic results on decidability of the isomorphism.     In this paper, we present the exp-log normal form of types---derived from the representation of exponential polynomials via the unary exponential and logarithmic functions---that any type built from arrows, products, and sums, can be isomorphically mapped to. The type normal form can be used as a simple heuristic for deciding type isomorphism, thanks to the fact that it is a systematic application of the high-school identities.   We then show that the type normal form allows to reduce the standard beta-eta equational theory of the lambda calculus to a specialized version of itself, while preserving completeness of the equality on terms.     We end by describing an alternative representation of normal terms of the lambda calculus with sums, together with a Coq-implemented converter into/from our new term calculus. The difference with the only other previously implemented heuristic for deciding interesting instances of eta-equality by Balat, Di Cosmo, and Fiore, is that we exploits the type information of terms substantially and this often allows us to obtain a canonical representation of terms without performing a sophisticated term analyses.

This provides a unique resource for research into building dialogue managers based on neural language models that can make use of large amounts of unlabeled data. The dataset has both the multi-turn property of conversations in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge datasets, and the unstructured nature of interactions from microblog services such as Twitter. We also describe two neural learning architectures suitable for analyzing this dataset, and provide benchmark performance on the task of selecting the best next response.

                non memoryless analog network coding in two way relay channel Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) can significantly improve the throughput of two-way relay channels. An interesting variant of PNC is Analog Network Coding (ANC). Almost all ANC schemes proposed to date, however, operate in a symbol by symbol manner (memoryless) and cannot exploit the redundant information in channel-coded packets to enhance performance. This paper proposes a non-memoryless ANC scheme. In particular, we design a soft-input soft-output decoder for the relay node to process the superimposed packets from the two end nodes to yield an estimated MMSE packet for forwarding back to the end nodes. Our decoder takes into account the correlation among different symbols in the packets due to channel coding, and provides significantly improved MSE performance. Our analysis shows that the SNR improvement at the relay node is lower bounded by 1/R (R is the code rate) with the simplest LDPC code (repeat code). The SNR improvement is also verified by numerical simulation with LDPC code. Our results indicate that LDPC codes of different degrees are preferred in different SNR regions. Generally speaking, smaller degrees are preferred for lower SNRs.

                approximate correlation clustering using same cluster queries Ashtiani et al. (NIPS 2016) introduced a semi-supervised framework for clustering (SSAC) where a learner is allowed to make same-cluster queries. More specifically, in their model, there is a query oracle that answers queries of the form given any two vertices, do they belong to the same optimal cluster?. Ashtiani et al. showed the usefulness of such a query framework by giving a polynomial time algorithm for the k-means clustering problem where the input dataset satisfies some separation condition. Ailon et al. extended the above work to the approximation setting by giving an efficient (1+\eps)-approximation algorithm for k-means for any small \eps > 0 and any dataset within the SSAC framework. In this work, we extend this line of study to the correlation clustering problem. Correlation clustering is a graph clustering problem where pairwise similarity (or dissimilarity) information is given for every pair of vertices and the objective is to partition the vertices into clusters that minimise the disagreement (or maximises agreement) with the pairwise information given as input. These problems are popularly known as MinDisAgree and MaxAgree problems, and MinDisAgree[k] and MaxAgree[k] are versions of these problems where the number of optimal clusters is at most k. There exist Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (PTAS) for MinDisAgree[k] and MaxAgree[k] where the approximation guarantee is (1+\eps) for any small \eps and the running time is polynomial in the input parameters but exponential in k and 1/\eps. We obtain an (1+\eps)-approximation algorithm for any small \eps with running time that is polynomial in the input parameters and also in k and 1/\eps. We also give non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the number of same-cluster queries, the lower bound being based on the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).

                2 stack pushall sortable permutations In the 60's, Knuth introduced stack-sorting and serial compositions of stacks. In particular, one significant question arise out of the work of Knuth: how to decide efficiently if a given permutation is sortable with 2 stacks in series? Whether this problem is polynomial or NP-complete is still unanswered yet. In this article we introduce 2-stack pushall permutations which form a subclass of 2-stack sortable permutations and show that these two classes are closely related. Moreover, we give an optimal O(n^2) algorithm to decide if a given permutation of size n is 2-stack pushall sortable and describe all its sortings. This result is a step to the solve the general $2$-stack sorting problem in polynomial time.

                that s sick dude automatic identification of word sense change across different timescales In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to identify noun sense changes based on rigorous analysis of time-varying text data available in the form of millions of digitized books. We construct distributional thesauri based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points. Subsequently, we compare these sense clusters of two different time points to find if (i) there is birth of a new sense or (ii) if an older sense has got split into more than one sense or (iii) if a newer sense has been formed from the joining of older senses or (iv) if a particular sense has died. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology both manually as well as through comparison with WordNet. Manual evaluation indicates that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 randomly picked samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples. Remarkably, in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, while in 46% cases and 43% cases split and join are respectively confirmed by WordNet. Our approach can be applied for lexicography, as well as for applications like word sense disambiguation or semantic search.
